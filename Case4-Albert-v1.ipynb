    "__History and Origin of Futures.__\n",
    "Futures trading evolved out of the need for buyers and sellers of goods to mitigate against price volatility and the counterparty risks inherent between parties to a transaction. When a producer of grain expects his crops to grow to maturity at a future time, his foremost concern is a price he can plan for and come harvest the assurance of a buyer for his crop. Thus in 1948, as the Great Lakes became linked to the Mississippi River via railroad and the Illinois-Michigan canal, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was formed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CBOT provided a mechanism to stabilize prices and regulate trade through the establishment of a grain exchange. It devised and facilitated the trading of futures contracts which were “legally binding agreements to buy and sell a standardized asset on a specific date”. Futures contracts are indispensable instruments behind all trade which have the following key features [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardized contract  - Making contract specifications identical across participants allows for trading these instruments easily transferable. As a result, the only variable is price, everything else such as the quality, quantity, physical delivery time and location are stipulated but standardized for all participants.\n",
    "- Exchange-traded - By establishing an exchange, counterpart risks are eliminated and parties have assurance that contracts are backed up by the exchange. Buyers and sellers transact anonymously on a platform where they are brought together to operate with ease in a highly liquid and optimized market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a futures contract, the \"forward price\" is predeterimed for a time in the future, hence the coloquial term \"futures\" to refer to the trading of these derivative products. In other words, buyer and seller agree on a future price based on both speculating that upon time of settlement, i.e. delivery date, the instrument will yield a profit. \n",
    "The market's \"invisible hand\" establishes the optimum price that provides sellers a hedge against price risk and speculators seeking to make a profit by predicting the price direction [2]. Upon expiration of a contract, a futures trader has 3 options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Settlement - The most obvious course of action is for the trader who is selling (short position) to deliver the asset and/or for the buyer (long position) to pay cash. \n",
    "2. Rollover<br>\n",
    "3. Offset the Position - "
