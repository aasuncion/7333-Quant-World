    "Futures trading evolved out of the need for buyers and sellers of goods to eliminate volatility of prices and eliminate the counterparty risk inherent between parties to a transaction. When a producer of grain expects his crops to grow to maturity at a future time, his foremost concern is a price he can plan for and coome harvest, a buyer will be available to take his crop. Thus in 1948, as the Great Lakes became linked to the Mississippi River via railroad and the Illinois-Michigan canal, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was formed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CBOT provided a mechanism to stabilize prices and regulate trade through the establishment of a grain exchange. It devised and facilitated the trading of futures contracts which were “legally binding agreements to buy and sell a standardized asset on a specific date”. Futures contracts are indispensable instruments behind all trade which have the following key features [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardized contract  - Making contract specifications identical across participants make trading these instruments easily transferable. As a result, the only variable is price, everything else such as the quality, quantity, physical delivery time and location are stipulated but standardized for all participants.\n",
    "- Exchange-traded - By establishing an exchange, counterpart risks are eliminated and parties have assurance that contracts are backed up by the exchange. Buyers and sellers transact anonymously on a platform where they are brought together to operate with ease in a highly liquid and optimized market.\n",
